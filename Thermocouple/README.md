## Thermocouple wires

* Experiment setup for seebeck coef. measurement  

![][Exp_fig1] 

* With C = V/(T-BgT), where BgT is the background temperature(=29 Uncompensated ,and =0 Compensated); C is the coef. and V is the voltage measurement.

![][Exp_fig2] 

* When the temperature increases, voltage is also increasing, the Seebeck coef. is the ratio of those values. Ideally, it is a constant in a small temperature range thus by knowing the voltage changes ones can measure the actual temperature.

* Apply thermocouple wires module "MAX6675" with Arduino
